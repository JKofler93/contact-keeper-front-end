# contact-keeper-redux-on-rails-client

 This is a simple CRUD app built using Ruby, Rails, React, Redux and Redux-Thunk,
 This app allows the user to create a contact, update a contact and delete a contact. 
 This was a practice app to get my Redux skills down....

Hello, thanks for stopping by!

Step 1: in terminal... npm install

Step 2: in terminal... npm start

Step 2.5: ensure react is running on... localhost:3001 or any other port that's not localhost:3000 due to [back-end](https://github.com/JKofler93/contact-keeper-back-end) running on it

Step 3: Play around with the app... or go to the [back-end](https://github.com/JKofler93/contact-keeper-back-end)
